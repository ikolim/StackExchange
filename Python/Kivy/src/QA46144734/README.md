# Kivy Screen Manager and Clock Object

This example illustrates how to use the Clock object to schedule function calls in the future at specified intervals to switch
screens from first screen to fourth screen. After the first screen has being displayed, it will change the first screen's text
from "Hi I'm the First Screen" to "Hi I'm the Fifth Screen".
