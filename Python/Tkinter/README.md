# TkInter

tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of 
Tcl/Tk.

The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available
on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.) You
can check that tkinter is properly installed on your system by running python -m tkinter from the command line; this should 
open a window demonstrating a simple Tk interface.

## History

Tk was developed as a GUI extension for the Tcl scripting language by John Ousterhout. The first release was in 1991. Tk 
proved as extremely successful in the 1990's, because it is easier to learn and to use than other toolkits. So it is no wonder 
that many programmers wanted to use Tk independently of Tcl.
